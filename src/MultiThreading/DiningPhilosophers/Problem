Dining Philosophers:
in the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are sitting around a circular table w/ 1 chopstick b/t each of them. A philosophers 
needs both chopsticks to eat, and always picks up the left chopstick before the one.

a deadlock could potentially occur if all philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time

using threads and locks, implement a simulation of the dining philosopher problem that prevents deadlocks
